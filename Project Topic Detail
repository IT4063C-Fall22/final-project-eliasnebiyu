 The issue that I will be exploring more onto this semester is something that I came across social media and news headlines, the climate change happening currenlty and how it is affecting not only the US, but also the rest of the world. 
 One country which I have seen being hit with the current change is Pakistan. 
 There is deadly floods happening in this country which is affecting the lives of millions of people in that country.
 That is why I wanted to see what the current trends that are happening in the world and how it affects people around the globe. 
 The datasets that I am using will show how practices like deforestation will affect the natural disasters and how they relate to each other and cause natural disasters like flooding.
 I will try my best to link man made practices happening in the world and how it directly correlates with these 
 natural diasters, I have picked flooding as I have mentioned before due to the current world crisis that is happening.
